# Machine learning summary ðŸ¤–

> Summary for the machine learning class at the University of Applied Sciences Karlsruhe

> NOTE this summary is archived...for probable future work, work was saved in the WIP Branch.

## Structure

1. Each topic is documented in a jupyter notebook and numbered in order
2. Each jupyter notebook consists of:

* *Theory* of the topic written in german strongly associated with the university lecture
* *Practical* coding example of the theory using python and dedicated libraries(`Sklear, pandas, ...`). This is written and documented in english.

## Practical machine learning excercises

The practical code related to the topics in this summary is located in a separate fork: [ml-kurs](https://github.com/daniel-vera-g/ml-kurs/)


## Usage

> You can just open every chapter on Github and the build in jupyter notebook renderer will show you the notebook contents

* GH Pages: TBD
* To use it locally, just clone it and run it locally using `jupyter notebook`

P.S: A minimal local python, jupyter, etc... setup is expected ;-) 

## Tech used

1. Runtime: Jupyter notebook
2. Code: Python(+ Libraries used in code)
3. Markup: Latex + Markdown + HTML/CSS
4. CI/CD: Github actions(TBD)
